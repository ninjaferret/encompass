				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2010 saw the official creation of Cambridgeshire Fire &amp; Rescue  Service’s first LGBT network. More and more staff are comfortable being out at work, and with the full support of management, send the signal it is fine to be open about yourself. The group gathers regularly, as a dedicated meeting space, but also as a more informal social support. Members represent the Service at conferences and workshops, and are usually merrily visible at local events such as Pride or the Pink Festival.</p>

<p>For information on the staff network please contact: Equality and Diversity Adviser at HQ, Tel 01480 444537</p>
