SUMMARY:
DESCRIPTION:LGBT History Month 2018 Networking Meeting\nRoom for a Second Course?\nAnother huge thank you to everybody who came to the LGBT History Month 2018 Networking Meze! There were lots of exciting ideas\, which we’re looking forward to hearing updates about at our next Networking Meeting on the 15th of September 12:00-13:30 at Anglia Ruskin University\, LAB006. \nAs before\, there will be 30 minutes of eating and chit-chat before we begin the meeting at 12:30. You can find a map of the campus here – the easiest way to find the room is to take the side entrance to LAB on Broad Street and follow the signage from there. \n
