SUMMARY:LGBT Blues Taster and Dance
DESCRIPTION: \nLGBT folk are warmly invited to come along and try out this laid-back and expressive partner dance! \nBlues dance has roots in African dance and an unbeatable soundtrack from classic to current. The class is suitable for complete beginners (we can also cater to those who have previous partner dance experience so do come along) and will run from 6pm till 7pm. There’s no need to bring a partner – we’ll switch partners regularly throughout. Afterwards\, try out your new moves to fantastic live music (and a little bit of queer blues history) from the talented Tom Colborn. Entry £5 on the door. \nCambridge Swing Dance is a non-profit community interest company aimed at promoting Lindy Hop\, Blues\, Balboa\, Collegiate Shag and other forms\nof swing dancing in Cambridge\, and helping the health and well being of both residents and visitors. \n
