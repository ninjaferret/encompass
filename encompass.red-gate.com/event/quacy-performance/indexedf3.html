SUMMARY:QUACY Performance
DESCRIPTION:‘Just A Little Longer’ is an original play devised by LGBT+ young people in Cambridge in collaboration with LGBT+ charity The Kite Trust. \nThrough a collection of stories\, join us as we learn how to keep strong as a community and smile even when we cry. We’re done with waiting. It’s our moment\, it’s our escape\, it’s our hope. All we want is just a little longer. \nWe’re not just one issue\, we’re made up of multiple issues that overlap. If we work together\, we can make change happen. \nPerformed by the young people of QUACY and directed by Acting Now’s Marina Pallares. \nFree booking with donation on entry\, grab your ticket here. \n
