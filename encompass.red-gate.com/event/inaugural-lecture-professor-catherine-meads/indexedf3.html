SUMMARY:Inaugural Lecture with Professor Catherine Meads
DESCRIPTION:Health and Wellbeing in Sexual Minority People. \nMuch progress has been made on investigating the differences and similarities in health and wellbeing between sexual minorities and the majority population. This lecture follows the highs and lows of one researcher trying to conduct research in this area from the early 1990s to the present day. \nRecent findings are starting to show consistent differences in physical health as well as mental health. Professor  Catherine Meads will be suggesting possible reasons for these findings\, and potential avenues for future research. \nCatherine is a specialist systematic reviewer who has been conducting and supporting research into sexual orientation and health for over 25 years. Systematic reviews are a research technique where all relevant studies on a specific topic are combined in a rigorous and unbiased way to help policy-makers and others interested. Catherine has a medical degree (1983)\, an MSc in Information Technology for Management (1994)\, a PhD in Psychology (2006) and a Masters in Public Health (2010). She has also been an LGBT Consortium Trustee and steering committee member of LGBT Health Summits\, and is currently an Encompass Trustee. She has conducted a number of systematic reviews in LGBT research\, including a recent project for Public Health England on health and experience of healthcare in UK sexual minority women. \n
