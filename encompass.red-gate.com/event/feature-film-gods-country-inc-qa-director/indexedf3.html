SUMMARY:Feature Film: Gods Own Country inc Q&A with the director
DESCRIPTION:Director: Francis Lee.\nStarring: Josh O’Connor\, Alec Secareanu\, Gemma Jones\, Ian Hart. UK 2017. 105 mins. \nJohnny Saxby (O’Connor) works long hours on his family’s remote farm in the north of England. He numbs the daily frustration of his lonely existence with nightly binge drinking at the local pub and casual sex. \nBut when a handsome Romanian migrant worker (Secareanu) arrives to take up temporary work on the family farm\, Johnny suddenly finds himself dealing with emotions he has never felt before. As they begin working closely together during lambing season\, an intense relationship forms – one that could change Johnny’s life forever. \nCaptivating and broodingly beautiful\, God’s Own Country is the award-winning debut feature from writer-director Francis Lee. Set in the heart of rural Yorkshire\, this is a bracingly openhearted romantic story marked by stunning lead performances. \nTickets can be purchased here:\nhttps://www.picturehouses.com/cinema/Arts_Picturehouse_Cambridge/film/gods-own-country \n
