SUMMARY:Pink Punting
DESCRIPTION:Meet at Scudamore’s boatyard\, Granta Place\, just upstream of Silver Street bridge\, by Queens’ College\, any time after 10am\, but no later than 10.30am (to make sure we can get enough punts before the tourists arrive). If anyone is planning to use a college punt\, please bring it up the rollers to the upper river in good time. \nBring: your own picnic and drinks. Also umbrellas\, sun block\, hats\, swimming costumes and towels\, to cater for all eventualities! Wind-up gramophones with some old 78s are also fun. \nEverybody welcome. Just team up with your friends or make new friends to hire a punt together (the cost is about £20 per person). We stop for a decadent picnic in Grantchester\, then head back to be in town just after 4pm. \n
