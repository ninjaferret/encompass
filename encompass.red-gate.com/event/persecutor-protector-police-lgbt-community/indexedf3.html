SUMMARY:From Persecutor to Protector: The Police and the LGBT Community
DESCRIPTION:As part of the launch of his new book ‘Gay in the 80s’\, Colin Clews will discuss with representatives of Cambridgeshire Police Service the dramatic turnaround in police attitudes towards the LGBT community. As recently as the 1990s police regularly entrapped gay men and harassed LGBT people. Now the Police have designated LGBT community liaison officers as well as their own LGBT police officers association\, Nexus. How has this extraordinary change come about after decades of police hostility? And what does it tell us about advancing LGBT rights in a hostile environment? \nCopies of the book will be on sale for the special History Month price of £10 (RRP £14.95). \n
