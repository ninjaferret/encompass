SUMMARY:Global LGBT+ Rights: A Conversation with Stuart Milk
DESCRIPTION:The University of Cambridge is delighted to welcome Stuart Milk\, international human rights activist\, LGBT rights speaker and youth advocate and he will be focusing on the current state of global LGBT human rights. \nAs the nephew of Harvey Milk\, the iconic civil rights leader\, Stuart has taken his uncle’s message of authenticity\, and his example of courage and the power of collaboration onto the global stage\, supporting local\, regional and national human rights struggles and emerging LGBT communities on the ground in over sixty-seven nations on five continents. \nHarvey Milk’s Vision \nHarvey Milk’s groundbreaking election in 1977 as one of the world’s first openly gay elected officials – and its most visible one – symbolized the freedom to live life with authenticity to millions of LGBT women and men around the world. Harvey served less than a year in public office before his brutal assassination but his life\nprofoundly changed a city\, state\, nation and a global community. His courage\, passion and sense of justice rocked a country and stirred the very core of a put-down and pushed-out community\, bringing forward new hope and a new vision of freedom. \nBook here. \n
