SUMMARY:Huntingdon Interact ‘Lets talk about porn!’
DESCRIPTION:Huntingdon Interact a social/support group for gay and bisexual men \nSexual Health Week is almost upon us and this year the theme is porn and this seemed like a brilliant subject to talk about in Interact!! \nWe all have opinions on it! \nIs it right?\nIs it wrong?\nAre the people who act/star in porn being exploited?\nIs that what sex is really like?\nAre the story lines actually any good? \nThen of course\, there are also the legal questions about it! \nAs Huntingdon Interact group will be meeting a little before Sexual Health Week (week commencing 11th September) I thought we could also talk about Porn! \nCome along and meet new people\, talk about your experiences\, find out about what ‘community’ events there are out there\, and get support to overcome any barriers you might experience in accessing the kind of social/support networks you want to be part of. The get togethers are informal and friendly and you can come for a short while or stay for the whole session. \nWhat is provided? \nLight refreshments provided\nFree condoms and sexual health information available! \nHow do I find out more? \nFor more information contact Graham by email on graham.lewis@dhiverse.org.uk or by phone on 07746 931709 or 01223 508805 (Dhiverse office)\, or even just turn up on the night. \nYou can also find more information on our website www.dhiverse.org.uk \n
