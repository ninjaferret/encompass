SUMMARY:Film Festival: Roobha
DESCRIPTION:Duration: 91 min \nCanada\, 2018\, 91 mins.\nDIRECTOR: Lenin M. Sivam\nWITH: Antonythasan Jesuthasan\, Amrit Sandhu\, Thenuka Kantharajah\, Sornalingam Vyramuthu \n  \n  \n  \nA unique romantic tale that deals with the complexities of gender identity. Roobha\, a trans-woman\, struggles to find her place after being ostracized by her family. Her chance encounter with a family man\, Anthony\, leads to a beautiful romance. But their blissful relationship soon comes crashing down for reasons not their own. Roobha is a beautiful film that confronts the transgender stigma and biases that exist within the Tamil community. Although revered in ancient times as incarnates of the Mohini\, transgender members of the community now often find themselves ridiculed and stigmatized. \nWe hope to welcome members of the cast & crew to the screening for a Q&A with the audience. \nThe Cambridge Film Festival is presented by the Cambridge Film Trust\, a registered charity with a mission to foster film culture and education for the benefit of the public\, in Cambridge and the Eastern region but also throughout the UK. \nAlso showing on 29/10 \n
