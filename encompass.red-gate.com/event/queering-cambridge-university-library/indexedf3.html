SUMMARY:Queering the Cambridge University Library
DESCRIPTION:Over the six centuries of its existence the University Library has built up a collection of over 8 million items\, covering virtually every aspect of human thought. To mark the end of LGBT History Month\, the University Library will hold a pop-up exhibition of LGBT+ related materials from its historic and modern collections. Items on display range from the 11th century to the 21st\, including evidence of gay life in medieval Cairo\, gender fluidity in 18th-century Japan and ephemera from the vibrant LGBT scene in 1970s Latin America. Use the hashtag #queeringtheul to share your thoughts on what you see.  \n
