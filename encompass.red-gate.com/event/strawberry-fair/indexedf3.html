SUMMARY:Strawberry Fair
DESCRIPTION:Strawberry Fair is a visual and musical extravaganza for all the family\, a jamboree for people of all ages. \nFirst and foremost\, Strawberry Fair is a feast for music lovers.   \nThroughout the Fair\, across 12 hours of the day\, you can enjoy an eclectic range of music and performances from well over 100 groups\, both local and from further afield.  \nWe partner with locally based groups such as Cambridge Cinema Shorts\, which run Strawberry Shorts\, the Fair’s film festival; local samba band Arco Iris who set the streets dancing as the parade snakes its way through the city centre; and the Cambridge Community Circus who thrill the crowds with their deftness and artistry.  \nThe Fair has community stalls where you can find out what local people are doing to make Cambridge a happy and happening city. And if you want to get your wallets out\, there’s crafts to buy and lots and lots of food to satisfy all tastes and appetites.  \nIn Cambridge the Strawberry season starts early\, with workshops\, benefit gigs and of course the Cambridge Band Competition (now in it’s 30th year)\, which starts with the new Under 18s competition in November\, through to the various heats and finals in March.  \n
