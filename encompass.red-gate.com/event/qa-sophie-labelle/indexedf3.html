SUMMARY:Q&A with Sophie Labelle
DESCRIPTION:We’re delighted to announce that renowned LGBT+ artist and author Sophie Labelle will be stopping by in Cambridge as part of her European tour! Sophie is author of well-known webcomic Assigned Male (https://www.facebook.com/assignedmale/)\, primarily focused on transgender issues. \nOver the past few years Sophie has been one of the most consistently positive and inspiring figures in the world of LGBT+ and trans activism\, her comics helping dispel common misconceptions about transgender issues and clearly demonstrating steps needed to be taken to increase transgender inclusivity. The event will consist of a talk by Sophie followed by a Q&A session. \nTiming permitted we hope to be able to dine with Sophie in formal hall in John’s afterwards\, both for any members of the college attending\, plus a somewhat limited number of guests – watch this space for more info! \nThe event is open to everyone\, free of charge with no registration required. Anyone with a Cambridge University card can come straight in\, and we’ll have people to collect those not university members and escort you through college. \nWe recommend entering through the Great Gate into First Court\, then continuing straight onwards\, through Second Court\, Third Court\, over the Bridge of Sighs\, then turning right in the middle of New Court towards the Cripps building\, then on your left you’ll find the Fisher Building \nThe event is wheelchair-accessible with an accessible toilet close by. There will be padded seating and easy means of exit during the event. Currently none of the nearby toilets are gender-neutral\, though we’ll look into changing that for the event. \nFor any enquiries\, please contact us via the St John’s LGBT+ or Cambridge Univerity LGBT+ Facebook page\, or email us at lgbt@cusu.cam.ac.uk \n
