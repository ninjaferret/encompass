SUMMARY:Queer Beers Does Eurovision!!
DESCRIPTION:Queer beers has become incredibly popular with over 70 people turning up in March. Eurovision is usually one of our biggest events in the meetup calendar\, so by putting both together\, we can make this a mega event! \nWeather permitting\, we will be outside watching Eurovision (don’t worry there are heaters!) on a big screen. \nSee – the ridiculous outfits\, \nHear – the dodgy singing\, \nWatch – the drama \nSo come along and have some fun… Bring a flag!!! \n
