SUMMARY:Confessions of a Queer Arab: my experience as a LGBT refugee
DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Shrouk El-Attar speaks about being an LGBTI refugee \nShrouk El-Attar is an Egyptian LGBT+ Rights Activist who has been living in Wales since 2007. They were forced to claim asylum in the UK following a series of events.\n\nGrowing up Queer to a Conservative Muslim family in Mubarak’s Egypt is not easy. And when finally thought to have reached safety in the UK\, the term “Safety” could not have been further from the truth. Shrouk’s involvement in the Egyptian LGBT+ scene is undoubtedly dangerous\, yet their experience of how the UK treats queer refugees poses new unexpected challenges.\n\nShrouk will share their story about being a queer refugee from Egypt\, a country where it is often considered the state’s\, the community’s\, and the family’s duty to punish lgbt+ individuals for who they are and who they love. They will also reveal information about some of the inhumane treatment queer asylum seekers are often met with at UK’s home office.\n\n
