SUMMARY:"Seen But Not Heard: Lesbian Identities in New Zealand" - Evan Hazenberg
DESCRIPTION:Evan Hazenbergâ€™s talk will focus on the substantial and relatively swift change in social attitudes after New Zealand decriminalised homosexuality in 1986. Using sociolinguistic data from queer and straight New Zealanders\, Hazenberg examines some of the sociophonetic correlates of lesbian identities in New Zealand against two very different social backdrops. \n
