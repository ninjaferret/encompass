SUMMARY:Eurovision Song Contest Party at the Arts Pic House
DESCRIPTION:Our monthly LGBT film club\, Queers in Shorts is extremely excited to bring you the Eurovision 2016 party! Join us in the bar for some classic Eurovision tunes old and new\, as we serve themed drinks and nibbles. Your ticket includes entry to Screen 3\, where you can watch this year’s contest on the big screen\, boradcast live from Stockholm! \nExpect cheesy extravagance\, styling that beggars belief\, misplaced national pride and perhaps more catchy tunes than you would like to admit. We’ll even have live compering from our very own Jen and Carlos in the screen too! \nAll ticketholders will be given a goody bag\, complete with scorecards and sweets! Come dressed as your favourite competing nation – there will be prizes for the best dressed! :)X \nMore details and to register your interest here \nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/476002982579069/ \n
