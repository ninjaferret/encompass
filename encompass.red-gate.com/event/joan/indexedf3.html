SUMMARY:Joan At The Junction
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Derby Theatre\, in association with Milk Presents. Written and directed by Lucy J Skilbeck. \nPut your drinks down and your hands together\, all the way from Domremy in France (via Sheffield and 600 years) it’s JOAN! \nPacked with guts\, heart and live music\, JOAN fuses lyrical new writing with drag king cabaret. An earthy story of courage\, conviction\, hope\, survival and love; this is Joan of Arc\, quite possibly the world’s first drag king. \nPerformed by Drag Idol Champion Lucy Jane Parkinson\, aka LoUis CYfer\, this is a fearless new show about what it means to stand out\, stand up and stand alone. \n
