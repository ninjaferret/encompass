SUMMARY:Queer Coffee
DESCRIPTION:Encompass has now secured a regular place and time for the whole LGBT+ community to get together for a coffee and a chat. It is upstairs at The Locker Café (the old clowns café). So tell your friends and everyone you can think of about this great opportunity to have another regular LGBT+ event in Cambridge. \n
