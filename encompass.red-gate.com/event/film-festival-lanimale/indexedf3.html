The gang\, with their revved up motocross bikes\, are the terror of the village and make life difficult for all the girls. But when Sebastian\, the leader of the pack\, falls in love with her and she becomes friends with Carla\, one of the victims of their bullying\, Mati runs the risk of losing her place with the boys. As Mati struggles with gender identify and sexuality\, life is not made any easier at home with her parents navigating their own emotional problems. \nThe Cambridge Film Festival is presented by the Cambridge Film Trust\, a registered charity with a mission to foster film culture and education for the benefit of the public\, in Cambridge and the Eastern region but also throughout the UK. \n
