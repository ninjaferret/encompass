SUMMARY:Interact
DESCRIPTION:Interact is a regular get together for Gay and Bi men.  You can attend any event for as long as you want i.e. you can drop in\, stay for the whole event\, come to every event or just occasionally. ItÕs a safe\, friendly and relaxed space where you can talk about your experiences\, find out about what community events there are out there\, and overcome any barriers you might experience in accessing the kind of social/support networks you might want to be part of.  We can also organise for speakers to come along if the group wants to hear about a particular topic or news item.  Light refreshments are provided but feel free to bring your own food.\nYou can pick up free condoms\, lube and sexual health information and if youÕd like 1-1 support or counselling\, just speak to Graham and heÕll be able to organise this for you. \n
