SUMMARY:Feature film: A moment in the reeds plus live Q&A
DESCRIPTION: \nWe’re delighted to welcome director Mikko Makela to our cinema for a Live Q&A following this special screening. \nHaving moved to Paris for university\, Leevi returns to his native Finland for the summer to help his estranged father renovate the family lake house. Tareq\, a recent asylum seeker from Syria\, has been hired to help with the work\, and when Leevi’s father has to return to town on business\, the two young men establish a connection in the heat of the Finnish summer. \nA Moment in the Reeds is one of the first queer feature films made in Finland. Viewing Finland from both the perspectives of an immigrant and an emigrant\, the film casts the long-marginalised voices of sexual and ethnic minorities centre-stage in a story about the search for freedom\, acceptance and a place to call home. \n
