SUMMARY:Future of Meetup Group
DESCRIPTION:Future of Meetup Group\, discussions with potential organisers\nAs previously discussed\, I am stepping down as an organiser of the group at the end of the year. In order for the group to continue\, we need other people to take over organisation of the group. Ideally\, I would love to hand over to a group of individuals who have some new ideas and would like to organise 1 or 2 events each per month . Some people have expressed interest\, but please do come along and letâ€™s discuss what we can do to keep the group going. It would be a shame to loose it. \n
