SUMMARY:LGBT History Month Afternoon Networking Tea
DESCRIPTION:The second in a trio of networking meetings working towards LGBT History Month 2018. After the success of July’s meze\, I’ve once more decided to step into the kitchen and prepare some nibbles for everybody to enjoy while we flesh out some of the ideas raised at the last meeting. On the menu are finger sandwiches\, tea\, and scones – please let me know in advance if you are gluten intolerant so I can buy appropriate bread! \nEvent at Anglia Ruskin University room LAB006 \n
