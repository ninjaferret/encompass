So if you can\, please bring some pennies for our collection tins! \nENTRY: £3 before 10pm // £5 after 10pm \nFYI\n– This night showcases LBTQ women and NB performers\, but is for all LGBTQ folx regardless of gender or stripe of the rainbow. \n– The Corner House has wheelchair access via the rear entrance\, but unfortunately no fully accessible toilet. \n– The toilets are single-cubicle\, on a flat level\, and one of the cubicles is quite spacious. \n– There is a well-lit second room with chairs\, tables and a door which can be closed to reduce background noise from the dance area. \n– There is sometimes a cat at the venue. \nQWeirdo is an initiative by Queer Women in Cambridge\, a community platform for all LBTQ+ women and non-binary people in and around Cambridge based on an ethos of radical inclusion. \n\n
