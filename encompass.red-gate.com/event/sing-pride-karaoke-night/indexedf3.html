SUMMARY:Sing with Pride - Karaoke Night
DESCRIPTION:Come celebrate in true Pride fashion in a karaoke night followed by the already traditional Dot Cotton club night. Our friends at Dot Cotton Club have an extra special treat for you this month! They’re opening their doors early – at 7pm – for us to host two hours of fabulous sing along karaoke (with happy hour drinks prices throughout!) before the dancing begins! \nThere is no entry fee to come SING WITH PRIDE and you can even stick around for the rest of the night at Dot Cotton Club without spending another penny\, saving on the £5 entry for those arriving afterwards! All we ask is that you donate! Just pop a quid in the bucket to sing a song or give what you can to help us put on the best event we can in 2019. \nOnce the final warbled notes of ABBA and Bon Jovi have faded\, the party will keep going with Dot Cotton Club bringing you tunes all the way from the 80s to today\, for you to dance to until 2am or until you fall over – whichever comes first! \n
