SUMMARY:Lesbian Pub Evening
DESCRIPTION:Regular lesbian pub evening in Cambridge. 3rd Friday of every month. We’ll be upstairs\, let me know if you’re coming along and we’ll keep an eye open for you. \nThis group has been going for a while and is usually attended by about 10 of us from Cambridge and wider afield. We’re a friendly bunch and always pleased to see new faces. \n
