SUMMARY:Interact - Cambridge
DESCRIPTION:A social/support group for gay and bisexual men\nNew Year – New You? \nCome along and meet new people\, talk about your experiences\, find out about what ‘community’ events there are out there\, and get support to overcome any barriers you might experience in accessing the kind of social/support networks you want to be part of.
