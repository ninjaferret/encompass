SUMMARY:History Month 2018 Networking Meze
DESCRIPTION:It’s that time of year once again when we start planning towards the upcoming LGBT History Month in February 2018! To kick off this year’s round of networking meetings\, I’d like to get things started with something a bit special! Personally\, I’ve grown bored of sandwiches\, crisps\, and pastries at meetings\, so to shake things up a bit I’d like to invite you all to our inaugural LGBT History Month 2018 Networking Meze! \nAll of the food put on will be made by yours truly\, including hummus\, tzatziki\, couscous\, and freshly baked bread\, so there should be food suitable for a range of dietary requirements! \nIf you are coming\, please RSVP by emailing info@encompassnetwork.org.uk so I have an idea of numbers. \n
