SUMMARY:Cambridge Amnesty LGBTI meetup
DESCRIPTION:All welcome to have a coffee and take action:) \nAmnesty International has recently launched an urgent action in response to the brutal police persecution of trans women in Indonesia (Read more on the network blog). We will take action on this. In addition\, we have decided to adopt the case of Sakris Kupila\, a trans man seeking gender recognition in Finland. Others ideas for campaigning welcome. \nThanks for your support! \nRichard Hopper \nCambridge Amnesty LGBTI Sub-group \n(Please note: the group will meet upstairs) \n
