SUMMARY:Rafiki: a film screening and panel
DESCRIPTION:We are thrilled to show this incredible 2018 Kenyan film\, a story of friendship and love between two young women. The film has been banned by Kenya’s Film and Classification Board due to its “homosexual theme and clear intent to promote lesbianism”. \nThis panel event will investigate the ways in which Africans championing LGBTI+ rights and stories can disrupt the project of postcolonial nation-building. Following a screening of ‘Rafiki’\, panellists will examine the question of why homosexuality specifically has become such a target and on what grassroots work is currently being done by activists and story-tellers in East Africa to shed light on the marginality of sexual minorities and eradicate homophobia and heterosexism. \n
