SUMMARY:'Freak Show' @ Arts Picturehouse
DESCRIPTION:“A feelgood story that’s defiantly celebratory“ \n– The Guardian \n  \n“An heir to the John Hughes teen-outsider fantasy legacy\, dressed up in glitter drag with a big fat inclusiveness message\, Freak Show is your basic Mike Pence nightmare.” \n– The Hollywood Reporter \n  \n“It’s exciting to see Lawther\, so affecting as the young Alan Turing in “The Imitation Game” and as a yearning gay teen in “Departure\,” crafting such a multifaceted gallery of queer portraiture early in his career.” \n– Variety \n  \nBased on the award-winning cult novel by James St James and in the vein of ’Clueless’ and ‘Napoleon Dynamite\,’ FREAK SHOW tells the moving\, heart-breaking and hilarious story of Billy Bloom (Alex Lawther)\, a boldly confident and eccentric teenager who faces intolerance and persecution at his ultra conservative high school\, and decides to fight back on behalf of all the misunderstood freaks of the world. Trudie Styler’s directorial debut\, FREAK SHOW stars Alex Lawther alongside Abigail Breslin\, Bette Midler\, and John McEnroe. \n
