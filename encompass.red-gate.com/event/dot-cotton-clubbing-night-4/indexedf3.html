SUMMARY:Dot cotton! Clubbing night
DESCRIPTION:Our Monthly Clubbing night. Usually a good fun night and often packed and bangin’! So let’s go P-A-R-T-Y! We meet at 8.00pm in a pub for a bit of “Pre-lash” before we go to the Q club on Hills Road where the club night is held. It is a bank holiday weekend so plenty of time to recover..So come and get in the party mood with us before hand ! \n
