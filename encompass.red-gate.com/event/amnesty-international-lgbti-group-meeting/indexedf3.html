SUMMARY:Amnesty International LGBTI Group Meeting
DESCRIPTION:Writing a letter\, sending an e-mail or signing a petition can make a huge difference. The work of Amnesty activists has changed thousands of lives around the world\, helping to save people from torture\, detention\, harassment and other abuses.  \nWe’ll be writing letters on behalf of\, amongst others\, Belarus LGBTI rights activist\, Ihar Tsikhanyuk\, who was questioned\, beaten and subjected to threats and abuse for being gay by police\, following the unsuccessful attempt to register the LGBTI NGO Human Rights Centre Lambda in January 2013.  \nYou can register for this event if you so wish\, or just drop-in! \nIf you are interested in letter writing and campaigning for LGBTI rights\, on a regular basis\, including for Ihar Tsikhanyuk who needs long-term support\, but you cannot make this event\, please get in touch with amnestycambridgecity@gmail.com . \nWe’ll be upstairs as usual. \n
