SUMMARY:Film Festival: Rafiki
DESCRIPTION:Duration: 82 min \nCambridge African Film Festival\nKenya\, 2018\, 82mins.\nDIRECTOR: Wanuri Kahiu\nWITH: Samantha Mugatsia\, Sheila Munyiva\, Neville Masati \nAlthough banned in its home country of Kenya\, this love story between two teenage girls received a standing ovation at Cannes. Rafiki is based on the short story by Ugandan author Monica Arac de Nyeko\, and director Wanuri Kahiu brings the secret relationship between Kena and Ziki to life on the politically-charged streets of Nairobi. The chemistry between the two characters sparkles with tenderness in a love story which has never been told in this context before. \nThe Cambridge Film Festival is presented by the Cambridge Film Trust\, a registered charity with a mission to foster film culture and education for the benefit of the public\, in Cambridge and the Eastern region but also throughout the UK. \n
