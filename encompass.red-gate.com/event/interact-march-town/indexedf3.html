It provides a safe space to sit and chat and meet other like-minded people. \nCome along and meet new people\, talk about your experiences\, find out about what ‘community’ events there are out there\, and get support to overcome any barriers you might experience in accessing the kind of social/support networks you want to be part of. The get together is informal and friendly and you can come for a short while or stay for the whole session. \nPlease contact Graham Lewis on graham@dhiverse.org.uk for more information. \n
