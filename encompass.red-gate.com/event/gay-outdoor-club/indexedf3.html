SUMMARY:Gay Outdoor Club
DESCRIPTION:The Cambridge group generally walk on the 1st Sunday of each month. We’re a friendly group and always look forward to seeing a new friend joining us. Sometimes a new friend may be nervous being their first time along\, but everyone will be welcoming and you’ll soon be at ease. \nNo special skill or equipment is required other than appropriate footwear and warm clothes in the winter. Shorts\, t-shirt and often sandals for the summer months. Mostly we walk in Cambridgeshire\, but occasionally stray into neighbouring counties. We usually meet at 11.00 and walks are an average 7-8 miles. \nWe enjoy a picnic and ‘comfort’ stops along the way and usually return to the cars at about 15.00. Afterwards we often we go back to the walk leader’s home for tea and cakes.\nCambridge group coordinator is Colin Barker assisted by Roger Orpin. You can telephone us on 01763 262647 \nhttp://www.goc.org.uk/groups/cambridge \n
