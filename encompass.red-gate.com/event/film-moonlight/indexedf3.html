SUMMARY:Film: Moonlight
DESCRIPTION:Director: Barry Jenkins. \nStarring: Alex Hibbert\, Naomie Harris\, Trevante Rhodes\, Ashton Sanders. USA 2016. 111 mins.  \nAmbitious in so many ways\, Moonlight is the story of an African-American gay man growing up in a USA that is perhaps even more intolerant than ever. In only his second feature after the brilliant but undervalued Medicine For Melancholy\, writer-director Barry Jenkins successfully employs three different actors to portray the same character at three different ages. \nCharismatic newcomer Alex Hibbert plays the young\, naive schoolboy living with his emotionally unreliable addict mother (Harris\, Our Kind Of Traitor); Ashton Sanders (Straight Outta Compton) is the bullied teenager fully discovering his sexuality; and American football star Trevante Rhodes gives a breakout performance as the confident drug-dealing adult\, a tribute to the role model who helped him endure his difficult upbringing. Never less than riveting\, Moonlight is already being showered with richly deserved awards. \n  \nBook here. \nThe film will be introduced by Dr. Daragh McDermott: “When Identities and Cultures Collide: A Discussion of Sexual and Social Identitites”. \n
