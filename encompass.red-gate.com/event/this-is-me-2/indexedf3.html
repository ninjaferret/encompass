Truth.\nWondrous things happen when we learn to love what makes us different. \nThis is Me is a funny\, tender exploration of what it means to be young and queer in Cambridge today. Devised by LGBT+ young people themselves and in collaboration with Acting Now and The Kite Trust\, the play details the experience of coming out and the magic of celebrating difference. \nBOOKING REQUIRED (Free booking with donations on the day of the event) – Get your tickets through our Eventbrite page or emailing us at hello@actingnow.co.uk \n
