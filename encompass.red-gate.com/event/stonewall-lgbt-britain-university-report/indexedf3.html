SUMMARY:Stonewall: LGBT in Britain - University Report
DESCRIPTION:This year Stonewall conducted the “LGBT in Britain: University Report” which shows that “for many lesbian\, gay\, bi and trans students\, the [university] experience can be marred by discrimination\, exclusion and abuse because of who they are.” \nThe report is extensive\, and we will be joined by Pete Mercer from Stonewall who will talk us through the results. He will be joined by a panel to discuss the findings. \nDr Miriam Lynn (University of Cambridge\, Equality & Diversity Consultant\, chair)\nPete Mercer (Stonewall\, Senior Account Manager)\nDr Natasha Tanna (University of Cambridge\, Lecturer)\nDr Nicki Ward (University of Birmingham\, Lecturer)\nRob Noon (NUS\, LGBT+ officer) \nThere will be tea\, coffee and biscuits from 12:15. The Darwin Room is just off the Pitt Building’s reception area. Everyone\, university and non-university alike\, are welcome to this event. \nCome to LGBTQ+@Cam’s first event of the year! Co-organised with Equality&Diversity at Cambridge University. \nco-hosted by Equality&Diversity \n
