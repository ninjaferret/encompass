SUMMARY:Transpositions
DESCRIPTION:In honour of the work of Nobel-prize winning plant scientist Barbara McClintock\, we celebrate her key concept of ‘Transpositions’ in an evening of performance\, ritual\, and artistic exchanges. \nResponding to the Reproductivities exhibition\, performance artist Sophie Seita’s commissioned piece Transpositions will reflect on the concept and choreography of transposition\, queer kinship\, corn as a queer plant\, ritual\, the ritornello\, and the cross-pollinating possibilities of flowery metaphors and of planting queer objects. The performance will include spoken text\, choreographed movement\, interaction with objects\, as well as recorded and live sound. \nAlongside Seita’s performance\, we invite the audience to engage with scientific\, artisanal and artistic mediations of maize – McClintock’s plant of choice – through the Reproductivities exhibition on display throughout the College. The performance will include an immersive\, participatory component and is followed by a Q&A with the artists and curators. \nhttps://www.lifeinglass.net/exhibition \nArtist: Sophie Seita \nReproSoc Curators: Sarah Franklin\, Lucy van de Wiel \nNew Hall Art Collection Curators: Harriet Loffler\, Sarah Greaves\, Eliza Gluckman \nCreative development\, live sound\, composition: Caroline Ophis \nCostume and book design: Jasmine Brady \nPoster: Naomi Polonsky \n
