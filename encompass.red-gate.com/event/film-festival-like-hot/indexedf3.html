SUMMARY:Film Festival: Some Like It Hot
DESCRIPTION:Duration: 121 min  \nUSA\, 1959\, 121 mins.\nDIRECTOR: Billy Wilder\nWITH: Marilyn Monroe\, Tony Curtis\, Jack Lemmon \nThis new restoration of Billy Wilder’s comic masterpiece promises an utterly joyous big screen experience. Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are two hapless jazz players on the run from the Mob. With no money and nowhere to hide\, they head for Florida with Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators – the main problem being that the Syncopators are an all-female band\, and Joe and Jerry aren’t women – yet. Then there’s Sugar (Marilyn Monroe)\, the band’s ukulele player\, who makes things especially difficult for her two new colleagues. Thanks to this stunning 4K restoration\, you will be dazzled by every sequin on Marilyn’s dress as she croons ‘I wanna be loved by you’… \nThe Cambridge Film Festival is presented by the Cambridge Film Trust\, a registered charity with a mission to foster film culture and education for the benefit of the public\, in Cambridge and the Eastern region but also throughout the UK. \n
