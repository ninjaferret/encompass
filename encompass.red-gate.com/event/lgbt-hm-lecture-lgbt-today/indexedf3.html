SUMMARY:LGBT HM Lecture - Being out and LGBT+ today?
DESCRIPTION:Panel discussion: Professor Elena Rodriguez Falcon from the University of Sheffield has entered the LGBT UK Leaders & Advocates Powerlist and is passionate about safe and supportive environments for all. \nWe hear a lot about the experiences of women in fields of study traditionally dominated by men. But the stories of lesbian\, gay\, bisexual and transsexual (LGBT+) individuals are barely touched upon. \nThe recent #ILookLikeanEngineer social media campaign\, which Professor Elena Rodriguez Falcon passionately supported\, has helped raised the profile of women working in the area. But it also made her think about other conversations about diversity that sector could be having. \nProfessor Elena Rodriguez-Falcon\, Professor of Enterprise and Engineering Education / Director of Enterprise Education / Faculty Director of External Affairs and Communications from The University of Sheffield will be sharing her experiences of being an out lesbian engineer at the University of Sheffield. \nDrinks reception to follow. \nEveryone is welcome. \n \n
