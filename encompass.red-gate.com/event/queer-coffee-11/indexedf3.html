SUMMARY:Queer Coffee!
DESCRIPTION:Encompass has now secured a regular place and time for the whole LGBT community to get together for a coffee and a chat. It is upstairs at The Locker Café (the old clowns café). So tell your friends and everyone you can think off about this great opportunity to have another regular LGBT event in Cambridge. \n \n
