SUMMARY:LGBTQ+ Book Club
DESCRIPTION:On the 25th\, we have decided to deviate from our usual discussion set up. For history month\, we will be reading an anthology of ‘Gay Life Stories’ by Robert Aldrich\, that gives voice to more than eighty queer people’s lives\, and we will have a workshop set up\, in which we will have black-out poetry\, collaging\, creative writing\, artist stations\, RAINBOW CAKE\, and much more! We want to celebrate the lives and efforts of queer people before us\, and have an evening where we can really spend time with each other. \n
