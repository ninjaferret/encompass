SUMMARY:Amnesty LGBTI Meetup
DESCRIPTION:Please join us on Monday 5 Nov in CB2 café (Norfolk Street) at 7.30 pm to have coffee and take part in Amnesty’s Write For Rights\, a campaign to write messages of support to people around the world who have suffered injustice. \nThis year\, we will be taking action for Vitalina Koval\, a high-profile member of Ukraine’s LGBTI community. She co-founded a community centre that provides a rare safe space for LGBTI people\, and fearlessly speaks out against hate. But Ukraine has seen a surge of far-right violence\, and Vitalina has been repeatedly threatened and attacked. \nAll welcome on 5 Nov ideas for campaigning. We normally meet upstairs in CB2\, and will have an Amnesty sign to help you spot us. Best wishes\, Richard \n
