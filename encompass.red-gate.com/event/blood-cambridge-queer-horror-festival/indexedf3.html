SUMMARY:Out For Blood - Cambridge Queer Horror Festival
DESCRIPTION:‘Out for Blood’ is a brand new independant horror film festival coming to the historical (and sometimes a little spooky) city of Cambridge! \nOut for blood is a horror festival with a slight difference – all of the films screening have either been made by or with someone who self identifies within the queer community\, or they deal with queer topics and queer characters. \nAs well as delivering you a frightful evening of gruesome tales\, we will be donating all proceeds and any extra donations from our more affluent guests to local LGBT+ charities. \nAfter an incredible 408 submissions to the film festival – we have worked tirelessly to build the most blood-curdling and varied film programme. Expect blood\, screams\, nightmares and some cackling laughter… \nBy Sammi Whitaker \n\nStrictly Over 18s Only\n\n
