SUMMARY:The Pink Punt
DESCRIPTION:A great opportunity to get to reach out to other LGBT+ groups and meet new people. \nPink Punting is back this year and once more it promises endless fun with friends\, family\, and members of the local LGBTQIA+ community. All levels of experience welcome\, even those who have never punted before. \nThe initial gathering is set for 10 am at Scudamore’s boatyard (although arriving after 10:30 could mean you may not find a punt). With six people per punt\, the all-day rent cost of £110 is £18 per person. CamCards are welcome as are college punts if available (please give passenger preference to those with difficulty to pay the cost). \nThe destination is Grantchester around 2 miles away\, where the picnic and the fun will take place at the riverside. Don’t forget sun block and hats\, swimming costumes and towels\, umbrellas\, and of course your own food and drink. As per previous years\, everyone will be back by 4:30 pm. \n
