SUMMARY:Older Persons LGBT Networking Event
DESCRIPTION:In 2014 Encompass\, the local organisation that seeks to support\, lesbian gay\, bisexual  transgender and intersex  people in the Cambs area\, published a needs assessment document based on questionnaires giving  an insight  into LGBTI people’s  experience. This furnished us with a rare opportunity to get a snapshot of what it means to be L.G.B.T. or I. in Cambridgeshire   –   you can download a  copy from  http://encompassnetwork.org.uk/uploads/LGBTQ-Needs-Assessmentabsolutelyfinal.pdf \nThe Needs Assessment document brought to light the significant problems that older LGBTI people can encounter.  In addition to  reference  to isolation and difficulty in  making social contacts\, other problems emerged.  As a result\, Encompass is organising a  networking meeting to exchange  and share experiences\, identify potential resources\, and\, hopefully\, formulate suggestions  and ideas for improving their situation. \nWe are inviting to the meeting representatives of a number of organisations and individuals who work with and/or have connections with  older people in the county\, and who play a role in contributing to their needs.  We are also \, of course\, inviting members of the LGBTI community to share their views. We very much hope that you will be able to attend it. \nThe  meeting will take place at the Meadows Community  Centre (I St Catherine’s Road\, off Green End Road\, Cambridge\, CB4 3XJ)  on Wednesday April 13\, 2016  from 12. 30 – 2.30 p.m.  Lunch will be provided.  RSVP to my email address or Encompass at info@encompassnetwork.org.uk \nCar parking is available at the Meadows Centre and there are roads nearby where you can also park. \nWe do hope that you can come to the meeting and look forward to the contribution  you can make.  Please tell other people you know with an interest in the topic that it is taking place. \nDo not hesitate to get back to me if you if you have any questions. \nAll the best\, \nPaulina  (Encompass Trustee) \npaulinapalmer@aol.com \n
