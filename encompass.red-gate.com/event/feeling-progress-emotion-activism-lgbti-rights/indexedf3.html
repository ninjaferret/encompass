SUMMARY:Feeling Progress: Emotion\, Activism\, and LGBTI Rights
DESCRIPTION:Movements for lesbian\, gay\, bisexual\, transgender\, and intersex (LGBTI) justice and equality generate emotion\, particularly among the activists who participate in them. Over the last 50 years\, feelings such as disgust\, despair\, hate\, anger\, and hope (to name just a few) have animated activist debates over the capacity of legal or political interventions to address the human rights of LGBTI people. This talk reflects on these ongoing debates by looking at how emotion shapes activist movements alongside legal and political reforms that seek to progress the human rights of LGBTI people. \nEvent organised by Cambridge Amnesty group\, as part of LGBT History Month. Free\, all welcome! \nAbout the speaker\nDr Senthorun Raj is Co-Director\, MA in Human Rights\, Globalisation and Justice at Keele Law School.
