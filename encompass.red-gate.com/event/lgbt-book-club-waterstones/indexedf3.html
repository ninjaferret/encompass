SUMMARY:LGBT+ Book Club @ Waterstones
DESCRIPTION:For our October meeting\, we will be reading and discussing Kate Bornstien and S. Bear Bergman’s Gender Outlaws. \nFifteen years after Bornstein’s groundbreaking Gender Outlaw\, this follow-up collection presents the wide-ranging voices of a new generation of gender radicals. In thought-provoking essays\, poems\, and comics\, contributors address the problematic nature of language and labels\, which often force people into two categories; “People get upset with transgender people who choose to inhabit a third gender space rather than ‘pick a side.'” A\nlack of acknowledgment of alternate gender labels in public spaces such as restrooms\, and on official documentation highlights this issue on a daily basis. Non-Western perspectives\, including a description of a ritual for Maasai women who can’t reproduce\, broaden the concept of “gender outlaw” and further challenge accepted notions of what is normal. \n
