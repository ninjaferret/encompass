SUMMARY:Brave Hearts\, Hidden Voices
DESCRIPTION:Hilary Cox Condron wants to add your voices\, creativity and thoughts to a piece of artwork and recorded archive she is developing for a Kettle’s Yard Open House exhibition. She is exploring our inner narratives – the non-instagram us- the thoughts and doubts that we all have and the hidden similarities between us all. The voice that motivates us to be us when we need to feel brave and do the things that make us us. \nIf you would like to contribute\, please drop-in to Cambridge Parkside Fire Station to get creative or take part in a short recording which will be broadcast on Radio 105 on the 13th of Feb as part of World Radio Day. \nIf you have any questions please email mshilaryc@gmail.com \n
