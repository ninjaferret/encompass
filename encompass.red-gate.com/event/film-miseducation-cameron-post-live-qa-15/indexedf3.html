SUMMARY:Film: The Miseducation Of  Cameron Post + Live Q&A (15)
DESCRIPTION: \n  \nThe Picturehouse is delighted to welcome director Desiree Akhavan for a Live Q&A following this screening.\n\n“Akhavan’s confident move\, in the end\, is that she can tell a story of a person finding their identity without depicting a transformation.” \n– The Atlantic\n \n“Cameron Post is set in the early 90s\, but gay conversion therapy\, which is still legal in 41 states\, has now become so widely acknowledged and debated over that the movie feels somewhat contemporary\, and potentially urgent for that fact.”\n – Vanity Fair\n \n“Chloë Grace Moretz puts in a career-best turn as a teen sent to ‘pray away the gay’ at a Christian camp in Desiree Akhavan’s compassionate LGBT story.” \n– The Guardian\n\n\nCameron Post (Chloë Grace Moretz) looks the part of a perfect high-school girl. But after she’s caught with another girl in the back seat of a car on prom night\, Cameron is quickly shipped off to a conversion therapy centre that treats teens “struggling with same-sex attraction”. At the facility\, Cameron is subjected to outlandish discipline\, dubious “de-gaying” methods and earnest Christian rock songs – but this unusual setting also provides her with an unlikely gay community. For the first time\, she connects with peers and is able to find her place among fellow outcasts.\n\nWriter/director Desiree Akhavan (Appropriate Behavior) and co-writer Cecilia Frugiuele sensitively adapt Emily Danforth’s acclaimed coming-of-age novel and create a refreshingly original teen movie. Balancing inherent drama with understated humour\, The Miseducation Of Cameron Post looks at a teenage girl grappling with pain and loss who\, at the same time\, creates a family on her own terms and learns what it means to empower herself by having confidence in her own identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPS: Fans will recognise Desiree Akhavan as the actor\, director\, writer and producer of The Slope\, a regular treat at Queers in Shorts.
