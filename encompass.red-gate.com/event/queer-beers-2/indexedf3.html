SUMMARY:Queer Beers\, Cambridge
DESCRIPTION:The manger of the Fort St George has offered to have a regular LGBT+ event every month at the pub. \nLast month over 50 people from across the whole community came along to what was a great night. So if you came along last time\, come again and bring a friend. If you didn’t come last month\, come along and bring a friend. Let’s see if we can get 100 people turning up ! \nSo please do make an effort to come a long and have a drink (or even some food if you’re hungry!) \n
