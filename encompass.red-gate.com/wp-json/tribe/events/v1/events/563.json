And if you want to get your wallets out, there&#8217;s crafts to buy and lots and lots of food to satisfy all tastes and appetites. <\/p>\n<p>In Cambridge the Strawberry season starts early, with workshops, benefit gigs and of course the Cambridge Band Competition (now in it&#8217;s 30th year), which starts with the new Under 18s competition in November, through to the various heats and finals in March. <\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"strawberry-fair","image":false,"all_day":false,"start_date":"2016-06-04
