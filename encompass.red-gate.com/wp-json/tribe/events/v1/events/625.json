The problem here is not homosexuality as such, but the &#8216;blackmailer&#8217;s charter&#8217; presented by the law as it then stood. The first British film to deal explicitly with homosexuality, Victim arrived in the wake of the public debate following the publication of 1957&#8217;s Wolfenden report. Despite the Wolfenden recommendations, homosexuality remained an imprisonable offence until 1967.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>For Dirk Bogarde, who signed on after the first choice had declined, Victim was a brave decision, given rumours about his own homosexuality (which he never acknowledged during his lifetime), but one that paid dividends, marking the closing of his &#8216;idol of the Odeons&#8217; period, and the beginning of a more serious phase which drew him increasingly towards the European art cinema.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.picturehouses.com\/cinema\/Arts_Picturehouse_Cambridge\/Whats_On\">here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","excerpt":"","slug":"victim-post-screening-discussion-cambridgeshire-police","image":false,"all_day":false,"start_date":"2017-02-09 18:30:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"02","day":"09","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2017-02-09 20:30:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"02","day":"09","hour":"20","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2017-02-09 18:30:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"02","day":"09","hour":"18","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2017-02-09 20:30:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"02","day":"09","hour":"20","minutes":"30","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"UTC+0","timezone_abbr":"","cost":"","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":[]},"website":"https:\/\/www.picturehouses.com\/cinema\/Arts_Picturehouse_Cambridge\/Whats_On","show_map":true,"show_map_link":true,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"Gay","slug":"gay","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":14,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":17,"filter":"raw","id":14,"urls":{"self":"http:\/\/encompass.red-gate.com\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/14","collection":"http:\/\/encompass.red-gate.com\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}},{"name":"LGBT History Month","slug":"lgbt-history-month","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":16,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":15,"filter":"raw","id":16,"urls":{"self":"http:\/\/encompass.red-gate.com\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/16","collection":"http:\/\/encompass.red-gate.com\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":[],"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Film: Victim + Post Screening Discussion with Cambridgeshire Police","description":"&lt;p&gt;Dirk Bogarde stars in this 1961 Classic at the Picturehouse! http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0055597\/?ref_=fn_al_tt_3 We\\'re delighted to welcome Gay in the 80s Colin Clews, and Cambridge City Police\\'s Sergeant Kevin Misik, for an introductory talk on the Decriminalisation of Homosexuality, as part of LGBT History Month 2017 \u00a0 Victim was one of the series of postwar \\'social problem\\' [&hellip;]&lt;\/p&gt;\\n","url":"http:\/\/encompass.red-gate.com\/event\/victim-post-screening-discussion-cambridgeshire-police\/","startDate":"2017-02-09T18:30:00+00:00","endDate":"2017-02-09T20:30:00+00:00","location":false,"performer":"Organization"}}
