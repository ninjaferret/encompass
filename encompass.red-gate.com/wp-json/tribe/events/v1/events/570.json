We&#8217;re a friendly group and always look forward to seeing a new friend joining us. Sometimes a new friend may be nervous being their first time along, but everyone will be welcoming and you&#8217;ll soon be at ease.<\/p>\n<p>No special skill or equipment is required other than appropriate footwear and warm clothes in the winter. Shorts, t-shirt and often sandals for the summer months. Mostly we walk in Cambridgeshire, but occasionally stray into neighbouring counties. We usually meet at 11.00 and walks are an average 7-8 miles.<\/p>\n<p>We enjoy a picnic and &#8216;comfort&#8217; stops along the way and usually return to the cars at about 15.00. Afterwards we often we go back to the walk leader&#8217;s home for tea and cakes.<br \/>\nCambridge group coordinator is Colin Barker assisted by Roger Orpin.
